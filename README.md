###Welcome to version 2048 6.3.2beta
##How to Play
* Two players enter......both players also potentially leave, one slightly more high spirited than the other after this, the greatest strategic game ever made!!! ...by me.
* Anyways, tiles slide towards different directions based on input.
* Player 1 uses arrow keys
* Player two uses a, s, d, w keys
* Tiles only add with tiles with equal values.
* First player to reach 2567241678 total score wins.
* Don't die.
